**What is machine learning?**

In simple term, machine is learning. But how? We train machine with some training data then machine will learn from it to make predictions when new data is being fed. Hence, machine learning is training computer/machine to learn from data.

**Types of Machine learning System**

**Does the training require human supervision?**

Can be Supervised, Unsupervised, Semisupervised and Reinforcement learning. 

Supervised learning: The training data fed to the system includes desired solutions. Examples, k-nearest neighbors, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees and Random Forests, Neural networks. 

Unsupervised learning: No teacher!! Unlabelled training data. Learns on its own by either detecting similarities, correlated features, anomaly detection, and assoication between attributes. Examples, Clustering (k-means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)), visualization and dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA), Association rule learning (Apriori, Eclat).

Semisupervised learning: Partially labeled training data. Example, Google photos recognizing family members in all the other photo when you labelled them in just one phot.

Reinforcement learning: Learn by experience. The system is introduced to the environment, gets rewards for positive experiences and penalties for negative experiences. Then it makes a strategy (policy) to get most reward. This policy is used to decide on how to react in a given situation. (Similar human example: we decide if we want to watch particular show on TV based on our experience (Reward/penalty) :) ). Examples, Robot learning how to walk.
